\setcounter{section}{1}
`Scilab' is a programming language widely used by researchers and students for scientific computations. Scilab is very easy to use and learn. But with easiness of use comes the 
problem of porting to different platforms (specially embedded devices) and execution speed where C coding takes the precedence. Wouldn't it be nice if there is an utility to 
convert scilab code to C code? Here comes the `Scilab2c' to help. `Scilab2c' is an extension for Scilab for converting scilab files to C code. This document gives an 
introduction about `Scilab2C', how to use it and flowcharts for `Scilab2C' extension.
Contents are arranged as follows:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Need for code conversion
 \item Introduction to `Scilab2C'
 \item How to use `Scilab2C'
 \item Flowcharts for `Scilab2C'.

\section{Need for code conversion}
As stated in introduction, Scilab is a high level programming language easily understood by majority of the scientific community. Since syntaxing is very easy to learn, 
it is preferred over other programming languages like C, Java or Python. But code written in Scilab is not portable to embedded devices as compiler for compiling scilab code
 to machine languages is not available. On the other hand, code written in C is easily portable to embedded devices because of the avilability of such compilers. But learning C
 and writing code in C is not that easy as syntaxing rules are quite strigent. So, an extension like `Scilab2C' is very useful for converting codes written in scilab to C code.
 Another advantage of C code is that it may consume less space in memory and execute faster than an equivalent scilab code. Hence, a covertor tool like `Scilab2C' is very 
 useful for the user.
